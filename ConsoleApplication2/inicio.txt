[ A = (0,0), B = (1,1) ] Distancia = 1.41mm

[ A = (0.00,0.00), B = (2.00,2.00) ] Distancia = 2.83mm

Usando variaveis: [ A = (0.00,0.00), B = (1.00,4.00) ] Distancia = 4.12mm

Usando constantes:
[ A = (0.00,0.00), B = (2.00,3.00) ] Distancia = 3.61mm

[ A = (0.00,0.00), B = (1.00,2.00) ] Distancia = 2.24mm
